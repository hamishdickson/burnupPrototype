burnupPrototype
===============

Note: this is a prototype, once I'm happy with this implementation I will create a web app for this.

Octave implementation of a burnup chart using machine learning.

The idea here is to create burnup charts using machine learning to help pick your teams velocity. This uses linear regression and will aim to predict the "most likely" finish date.

As with all machine learning tools, the more data that can be fed to this the better.
